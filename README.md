# Soccer_Predictions Project

## This program predicts what the score will be of a Premier League Game

/* NOTE THAT THERE IS NO OUTSIDE USAGE DUE TO NEEDING DATABASE CREDENTIALS */

* This program is built using Java as the language 
* Uses MySQL for the database and JDBC for the connection
* Gathers the information using Jsoup for web scrapping.  

## How it Works
The program asks for an input of a Premier League team and searches that team's upcoming game. It will then take the information from the database and give the user a prediction for the game.
